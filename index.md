# Lambda-Term

Lambda-Term is a cross-platform library for manipulating the terminal. It provides an abstraction for keys, mouse events, colors, as well as a set of widgets to write curses-like applications.

The main objective of Lambda-Term is to provide a higher level functional interface to terminal manipulation than, for example, ncurses, by providing a native OCaml interface instead of bindings to a C library.

Lambda-Term integrates with zed to provide text edition facilities in console applications.

The [README](https://github.com/ocaml-community/lambda-term/blob/master/README.md)
contains simple examples.
